    <!-- Step 1: Include the Script for the Hydrogen Payment Gateway -->
    <!-- The script source is provided by the Hydrogen Developers and contains necessary functions for payment processing. -->
    <script
      src="https://hydrogenshared.blob.core.windows.net/paymentgateway/paymentGatewayIntegration_v1PROD.js"
      module
    ></script>

    <!-- Step 2: Create a Button to Trigger the Payment Modal -->
    <!-- This button is used to trigger the payment process. When clicked, it will call the `openDialogModal()` function defined in main.js file. -->
    <button id="myBtn" onclick="openDialogModal()">Checkout</button>

    <!-- Step 3: Include the main JavaScript File -->
    <!-- The `main.js` file contains the main logic for handling the payment process, such as initializing the payment, handling callbacks (success, failure), 
    and checking the payment status. Ensure the file is properly linked to the HTML. -->
    <script src="main.js"></script>
